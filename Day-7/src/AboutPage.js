There are financial, legal, compliance, security, and cost implications to consider, particularly when it comes to employing a flexible, geographically distributed workforce. Companies that self-administer their extended workforce internally without a VMS can find themselves with administrative and managerial challenges. Workers and labor contractors may be spread across countries or continents with varying compliance and labor laws or spread across company departments with varying internal processes and technologies. With many parties and geographies involved in the talent sourcing, hiring, and on-boarding/off-boarding process, there is vast potential for miscommunication, inefficiency, untracked processes, and little visibility.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
